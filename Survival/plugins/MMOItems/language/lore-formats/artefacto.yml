# This is the way stats are organized in the item lore.
# You can remove or change line positions as much as you like to.
# Make sure each line ONLY has the placeholder as text.
#
# The lines starting with {bar} are strips that will be
# removed from the lore if there is nothing under it.
# The lines starting with {sbar} will stay whatever is below them.
#
# Reload with /mmoitems reload
