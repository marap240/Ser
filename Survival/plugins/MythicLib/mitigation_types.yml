# Blocking

  # If none of your plugins use the old MythicLib mitigation
  # events, you can safely remove/comment out this option.
  legacy: block

  # Formula for cooldown between two consecutive blocks (in seconds)
  # To disable cooldown, delete this line, or comment it out
  # Note that, by default, cooldown reduction is capped at 80% (see stats.yml)
  cooldown: '3 * (1 - <stat.block_cooldown_reduction> / 100)'

  # Chance to successfully block an attack
  # This formula should return a value between 0 and 1 (0 being 0% chance, 1 being 100% chance)
  # Note that, by default, block rating is capped at 80% (see stats.yml)
  roll: '<stat.block_rating> / 100'

######################################
# Parrying
#
# Parrying an attack completely negates all incoming damage and
# reflects a portion of the damage back to the attacker
######################################
parry:

  # For backwards compatibility only.
  # If none of your plugins use the old MythicLib mitigation
  # events, you can safely remove/comment out this option.
  legacy: parry

  cooldown: '3 * (1 - <stat.parry_cooldown_reduction> / 100)' # Cooldown between two consecutive parries (in seconds)

# You can edit existing mitigation types, add your own, copy and duplicate existing ones, etc.
# There are no limits on the number of mitigation types you can have.
# MythicLib provides 3 built-in mitigation types: block, parry and dodge as these are the most common ones in RPG games
